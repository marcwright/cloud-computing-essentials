## What you will need

At a minimium, you need the following items to complete this course 

- A development machine with the following:
    - Docker
    - VS Code
    - A Terminal
- An Azure Subscription
- The source code associated with this course

>**Note:** The above (and more) is likely provided for you as part of this course

## Pre-Provisioned Environment

If the environment is provisioned for you, then you will need to go through the following steps:

1) Send your work email and your personal email (likely your-name@somecompany.com and your-email@someemaillikegmailyahoooroutlook.com)
2) Once we have both of your emails, you will receive an invitation to get a cloud lab machine from us, sent to your work email
3) You will accept the invitation from your work email to log into the [Azure Labs](https://www.azurelabs.com), where you will get a VM assigned to you
4) Start the VM by getting the connection information from Azure Labs and using RDP from your local machine
5) Once you are on the Dev Machine, open a browser to your personal email.
6) From your personal email, you'll have an invitation to join the Azure Subscription via a link to [the Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) 
    > **IMPORTANT** Do not use your work machine or try to log into the Azure portal from your work machine with your personal email.  This needs to be done from the Lab VM only.  If you use your work email you will likely be in your work's Azure subscription or blocked from ours so you will not be able to complete the work for this course.
7) After accepting the invitation and logging into Azure using your personal email on the Lab VM, validate you can see one resource group (something like `student0025` where the number is just the student number we have assigned you.
    > **Note**: You can view resource groups by typing `Resource Group` in the top middle search bar on the browser and hitting enter.

You are now ready to begin the class.  Good Luck! Have Fun! Enjoy the training!
